# Keyboard
This sample implements a pathfinding algorithm using matrix multiplication. 
The pathfinding algorithm is used on a qwerty keyboard layout and can be changed between 3 different layouts. 
It measures the distance between keys in a string and gives the shortest possible distance you would have to travel.
